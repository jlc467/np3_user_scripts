## Kindle 2 NP3 (userscript)

This userscript inserts these clickable links into "Your Notes and Highlights" page:
- "new" -- Create a new note with the book title, adds annotation(s) to it (single or all)
- "append" -- Append annotation(s) (single or all) to an existing note with the book title
- "copy" -- Copies annotation(s) (single or all) to clipboard

In addition, it keeps track of which annotations have been exported by saving to your userscript extension's local storage.
